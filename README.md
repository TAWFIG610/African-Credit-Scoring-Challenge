# African Credit Scoring Challenge

🚀 I’m excited to share that I recently participated in the African Credit Scoring Challenge on Zindi, finishing 379 out of 1,024 with a top accuracy score of 70%! 📊💡

This challenge was a great opportunity to apply my knowledge in loan default prediction using financial data, leveraging deep learning models to tackle real-world problems. 💻🔍

The experience strengthened my data science, machine learning, and deep learning skills, and I’m looking forward to more exciting challenges! 💪🚀

This project aims to predict loan defaults based on financial and economic data using deep learning models.
